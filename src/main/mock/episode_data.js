    name: 'Winter Is Coming',
    description: 'In the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, a soldier of the ancient Night\'s Watch flees an attack by supernatural creatures, the White Walkers, thought to be mythical. At Castle Winterfell Eddard "Ned" Stark, Warden of the North, decapitates him for desertion. In King\'s Landing, Jon Arryn, the King\'s Hand, dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert Baratheon, Ned\'s old friend, offers Ned the position and proposes marriage between his son Joffrey and Ned\'s daughter Sansa. Ned\'s wife Catelyn shows him a letter from her sister Lysa, Arryn\'s widow, saying that Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters, Queen Cersei\'s family. Catelyn believes the Lannisters are plotting against Robert. Ned\'s young son, Brandon, climbs a tower; he witnesses Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime, who pushes Bran out of the high window. Meanwhile across the Narrow Sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen coerces his sister, Daenerys, to marry a Dothraki warlord, Drogo, in exchange for an army to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. A wedding gift is three apparently fossilized dragon eggs.',
